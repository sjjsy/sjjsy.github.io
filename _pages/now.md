As per the idea of the [now page](https://nownownow.com/about) the following 
presents what I'm currently up to. The subsequent sections describe some of my 
goals for my more or less distant future. As you can <!-- , and a log of past goals -->
see below, I structure my annual goals around my [guiding 
values](/about/#what-are-my-values) such that none of them are neglected: 
However, note that this page reflects only a subset of the totality of goals 
and tasks that I maintain for myself.

## Current goals

Currently, I'm focusing on six things:

1. Fulfilling my childhood dream of establishing and maintaining a personal
   website.
2. Starting a full-time job that fits my goals/values.
3. Finding an apartment to buy with my wife.
4. Helping to establish a startup.
5. Training West Coast swing dancing as much as I can.
6. Being social and loving to people around me.
