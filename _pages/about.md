</figure> 

**I am Samuel**, a loving **husband**, brother, son, friend, human being, and 
a fresh **alumni of Aalto University** aspiring to become an expert in 
contributing to the development of technology-intesive organizations. I am 
also a West Coast swing **dancer**, all-year commute **cyclist**, 
long-distance **runner**, martial arts and **multi-sport enthusiast**, 
**nature lover**, **photographer**, and a **nerd** over many subjects. I was 
raised in a **Finnish-French** family in the countryside of Southwest Finland, 
completed my upper secondary school in Turku and moved to the Helsinki Area to 
pursue higher education.

<!-- I am a fresh **alumni of Aalto University** Department of Industrial 
Engineering and Management. I majored on **strategy and venturing** but also 
studied data science, analytics and a lot of software engineering. I am eager 
to launch a successful and quickly evolving **career in consulting**. Why 
consulting? To sustain a high rate of learning! I aspire to one day have the 
confidence and expertise to leaderfully collaborate in the birth and/or growth 
of a new world-scale technology-based business venture in Finland. -->

## Why this website?

I created this website to make it easier for you to learn about me, and to 
encourage myself to share more. I believe in informed and data-based decision 
making in everything we do which is why transparency and access to information 
is important. I hope this website helps in building a more complete picture of 
who I am and how we might better collaborate. Finally, building and having a 
personal website has been a dream of mine since the day I first met the 
Internet. Yet another dream come true!

Via this website you can...

- Check my [now](/now/) page to learn what I currently do and what are
  the short and long-term goals that I focus on;
- Study my [résumé](/resume/) page to learn about some of my achievements
  and professional experiences;
- Read my [blog](/blog/) to get an understanding of what I have written about;
  and finally,
- View my [connect](/connect/) page to learn how to best connect with me!

## What do I believe in?

<figure style="width: 200px" class="align-left">

I vouch for [liberty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty), [human 
rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights) 
and the [rule of law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rechtsstaat), democracy, 
and social, economic, and environmental sustainability. I think eradicating 
corruption in all its forms is one of the most urgent socio-political 
challenges. I believe that through good leadership and both hard and smart 
work we can solve almost any challenge. I believe in the power of opennes, 
transparency, data and analysis to enable the building of bridges through 
facts, thus boosting collaboration and progress. I believe in being positive 
but also in being realistic. I believe that if everyone, instead of 
complaining and waiting others to act, would squeeze even just a little bit of 
effort daily toward reaching good compromises, the world would quickly become 
a much better place.

## What is my life philosophy?

I believe that happiness is best enjoyed as the unintended side product of a 
deliberate human struggle to find meaning by serving the [Reverence for 
Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverence_for_Life) through the courageous 
and leaderful application of one’s individual physical, intellectual and 
creative capacities while always striving to maintain a healthy balance with 
the opinions and aspirations of the self versus those of the environment.

## What are my values?

My guiding values are:

1. *Integrity* -- Authenticity; Honesty to one's self and others; Clarity in
   personal values, vision & purpose; Living by one's values and words;
   Self-confidence & balance between humility and pride.
2. *Love* -- Care for one's self, others and the world; Patience; Support;
   Exchange; Responsibility.
3. *Liberty* -- Autonomy; Leadership; Exploration; Self-expression; Pleasure.
4. *Cultivation* -- Curiosity; Culture; Learning; Building; Development;
   Growth.
5. *Service* -- Giving & charity; Mission & role; Strategy & action;
   Intelligence & energy; Agility & persistence; Joy of giving & achievement.

I try to balance with and stay true to all these five guiding values by 
structuring my [goals](/now/#horizon) around them such that none of them are 
neglected.

## What do I love?

<figure style="width: 200px" class="align-right">

  <figcaption>A patch of silver birch forest in Säijä in 2016.</figcaption>
</figure> 

The section above describes not only what I value but also what I love. 
However, I also **love to envision, plan and accomplish**. I love **driving 
and witnessing growth**, progress and learning. This love inspires me to 
**invest, build, cultivate** and **analyze** and work hard in doing so. I love 
to exercise my liberty in building things that comply with my values and are 
likely to be of great service to myself and others. I love being useful and 
productive. This is why I try to maximize the time I invest in cultivating, 
building and developing and minimize the time I spend in activities that 
contribute little to the future. Moreover, my desire to be efficient with 
resources does not limit to just time, but also energy, money and nature.

This partially also explains why I created this website. I enjoy the idea that 
everything I do builds me, my personality, my knowledge, skills and interests, 
and that this website is able to capture some of that such that other people 
can analyze it, relate to or question it, and react to it. The idea motivates 
me to collect, organize and share some of the many bits of who I am and what I 
have done -- how I have progressed -- for easier access and analysis by myself 
and others. They say that maintaining an online presence of yourself pushes 
you to become the best possible you. I would love to witness the evolution of 
this website and see its impact on who I become!

## What is my mission?

I believe my mission is to contribute to the development of organizations, 
technologies, and practical solutions that facilitate a) collecting, accessing 
and sharing data, b) analyzing and refining data, and c) making data-based 
conclusions and decisions. I believe my mission is to improve private, 
corporate and public decision-making and to eradicate corruption by 
incentivizing broadly beneficial behaviour by helping to increase transparency 
and knowledge.

<figure style="width: 200px" class="align-right">

</figure> 

I believe many of the most pressing challenges of our time, including those 
related to eg. the unsustainable use of resources, pollution and various other 
[tragedies of the 
commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons), as well as 
those related to corruption, violations of human rights and other inethical 
acts, are largely possible because of lack of transparency and knowledge. I 
believe [Veritas vos 
liberabit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veritas_vos_liberabit)!

I believe this mission requires me to cultivate myself such as to become 
expert in contributing to the development of technology-intensive 
organizations. Due to my love for Europe and my home country, I also take 
responsibility in finding my way to significantly contribute to the 
revitalization of the Nordic technology scene, perhaps by helping to establish 
and/or lead the next Finnish technology giant, and thus contribute also to the 
welfare of the people who generously enabled me to study and grow in 
prosperity.

This mission is interesting to me not only because of its positive societal 
impact, but also due to its fit with my passions and skillsets while enabling 
me to still make enough to give also to my family and friends and thus lead a 
very satisfying personal life.

<!--
- To help build information systems that by increasing transparency and
  informati on facilitating fact-based decision-making help in a) 
  incentivizing broadly beneficial behaviour, thus decreasing corruption, and 
  b) minimizing the tragedy of the commons and improve the efficiency of human 
  societies .

  Based on everything I have learned of the planet and human nature, I believe 
  eradicating corruption and the tragedy of the commons are probably the two 
  most critical megaproblems of today. In order for these to be solved we need 
  to increase transparency and access to data and information, and to create 
  trustworthy and practical tools to facilitate fact-based decision-making.

- To contribute to the building of Finnish technology giants that will 
  strengthen Finland and Europe and afford faster transition to more efficient
  and sustainable living in our planet.

  The seeds for this purpose were planted in my childhood and strengthened by 
  my personal strengths and growth trajectory. However, a major source of 
  inspiration was and is Risto Siilasmaa who gave a talk in Design Factory in 
  my freshman year in ESTIEM Vision Helsinki in 2009. He warned of a bleak 
  vision of the Nordics and the whole of Europe slowly turning into a cemetary 
  because of our lack of energy, ambition, growth and innovativeness. 
  Industries and firms of yesterday dominate Europe and the innovators and 
  technology giants of tomorrow grow and thrive mostly only in the US and 
  increasingly in Asia. This trajectory must be changed to protect and promote 
  the legacy of European civilizations and give authority to European values, 
  including liberty, democracy, equality and human rights. Why tech? Because 
  it is tech that I believe will afford humanity most room for growth and 
  jumps in productivity, efficiency and prosperity in the next 40 years.

## What do I do?

Because I have many passions and broad interests I pursue a variety of goals 
and do a diversity of things. To balance my use of time and energy across all 
of what I love and aspire to achieve I apply the 
[GTD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done) methodology. This 
practice affords me the space, time and tranquillity required to focus in 
achieving even big goals. See my [now](/now/) page to learn what my goals 
are for the moment, and for the near future, and how I have recently spent my 
time.

However, here are some things I tend to do continuously even if they are not 
explicitly listed in my goals. These also show how my personality and life 
philosophy is demonstrated in my daily life:

1.  **I analyze**. In addition to applying GTD, I constantly monitor and 
    analyze my time use in order to help me be more mindful, efficient and 
    effective with the time I have. Similarly although less frequently, I also 
    monitor and analyze my use of other resources, including money and 
    emissions, and follow the [PDCA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDCA) 
    method to improve. To do this in practice, I use software I've written 
    myself.
2.  **I dream**. I always have multiple side projects and goals on various areas of life.
    Because of my curiosity and ambition, my GTD inbox and horizon lists are
    never void of exciting objectives and tasks to accomplish. This means I'm
    never bored but it also means I never have excess time to waste.
3.  **I move**. Because health, physical fitness and ability is important for me, I do
    various kinds of sports almost daily. Recently I've been into running, 
    cycling, strength training, bodypump and swimming. I also frequently 
    compete against myself in running Cooper tests, marathons, doing 
    long-distance ski, trekking or kayaking trips. I also do stretching and 
    yoga to maintain my agility.
4.  **I dance**. Dancing has always been my favourite party activity. I enjoy
    challenging myself in how attuned and responsive I can be to my partner, 
    to the music and to the feeling -- how creative, beautiful and intense we 
    can be.
5.  **I train**. I test my limits also in more technical activites. Previously
    I've trained martial arts, including Thai boxing and Brazilian jiu-jitsu.
    Since autumn 2017 I've been rather intensely training West Coast swing.
    I've also taken classes in Argentine tango, cross body salsa, Brazilian
    zouk, ballet, hip hop, jazz, and modern dancing.
6.  **I invest**. In addition to investing my time, I invest my other resources,
    including my money. I invest in stocks, real estate, and forests. I also 
    love photography because I see it as a form of investing. Taking a minute 
    on a special day to take a great photo can provide a lot of value to many 
    people, especially several years later.
7.  **I compensate**. I try to increase my efficiency with natural resources
    and thus minimize my ecological footprint by eg. 1) limiting my transport 
    mileage, especially via air, and doing my daily commuting by bike; 2) 
    being mindful, minimalist and efficient with my consumption of services 
    and things thus investing into the proper use, maintainance and recycling 
    of things I own and/or use and sharing things I do not need all the time, 
    such as our car; 3) minimizing food waste and avoiding red meats and 
    limiting my consumption of poultry, dairy products, avocadoes, rice, and 
    other resource heavy foods; 4) sharing my house with six other 
    individuals; 5) contributing to [Compensate](https://compensate.com/) and 
    finding other ways to go strongly carbon negative; and 6) promoting 
    awareness and action to decrease the use and spoiling of natural resources 
    as well as increase the efforts to capture carbon and recover natural 
    resources and environments.
8.  **I study**. I constantly study new information from a plethora of news
    and media sources, as well as from knowledge repositories such as
    [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/) and non-fiction literature. I aim
    to keep myself civilized and informed in order to ensure my mindfulness
    is worthwhile.
