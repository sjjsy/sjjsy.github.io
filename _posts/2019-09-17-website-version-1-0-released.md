Today, I finished rebooting this website ontop of my fork of [Minimal 
Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/).

The design of Jekyll and Minimal Mistakes was somewhat straightforward and 
quick to understand which helped me implement the customizations I wanted 
rather quickly. However, because working the texts and other content took quite
some time the project ended up consuming several days.

In case you would be interested in developing a site of your own, feel free
to study my [repository on GitHub](https://github.com/sjjsy/sjjsy.github.io).

Other resources I found very useful include the following:

- [Jekyllrb docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/)
- Minimal Mistakes [GitHub repository](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes),
  [docs](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/)
  and its examples, such as [this](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/markup/markup-image-alignment/)
  (on markup).
- [FontAwesome Icon Gallery](https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery&s=solid&m=free)
- [Kramdown syntax](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html)

<!-- In the future I am probably considering getting my own domain name for the 
site. Perhaps I might also migrate the site out of GitHub to facilitate 
controlling who can see what. -->

Feel free to [connect](/connect/) and share me your thoughts on the outcome!
