Today, I scrapped my old website exercise draft and replaced it with minimal
foundations for my future personal website.

I did this because I increasingly want to shift my online presence from 
commercial social media services to my own personal website that I can 
completely control and personalize. I like the concept of a traditional 
personal website even when various existing social platforms make it very easy 
to establish and maintain presence online.

I opted for a static design for its simplicity, robustness and elegance and 
[Jekyll][jekyllrb] for its maturity and GitHub compatibility. The project of 
course provides also yet another opportunity for learning and creativity. 
First I'm going to have it generously hosted by GitHub but it might very well 
find a new home soon.

I hope the big work in gaining the momentum is now done and thus it is going 
to be all downhill from here. :)
