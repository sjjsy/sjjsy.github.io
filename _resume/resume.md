## <i class='fas fa-tasks'></i> Career goals

Long-term goals

: My *long-term* career goals include the following:

  - Cultivate myself such as to become expert in contributing to the 
    development of technology-intensive organizations and subsequently earn the 
    trust to be asked to participate in a key role in the establishing and/or 
    development of a Nordic technology giant.

Note: I am motivated to expand my knowhow and toolbox. In addition, I believe 
my greatest strengths include enthusiasm, energy and drive which allow me to 
forcefully tackle any challenge, including learning new skills and knowhow. I 
am thus very willing to invest free time into eg. expanding my language 
skills, especially if such investment is likely to be professionally 
beneficial even in the short-term.

  military service.
  See the [experience description](#maol-dtc) for more info.

## <i class='fas fa-heartbeat'></i> Non-professional passions

While I am goal-oriented and active in my professional life, I am similarly
ambitious and active in my personal life:

Running
: I have thus far completed four marathons (and the fifth is already
  scheduled) and many more shorter distances. My personal bests are
  3h14 for a marathon, 1h32 for a half marathon, 38:50 for a 10 km, and
  14:50 for a 4 km. I have placed at the top three in some smaller events,
  and eg. during my military training I scored highest in my company in the
  new recruits' Cooper's test. I also participated in a team representing my
  company in an orienteering competition and in a relay running competition.
  The latter was organized during my training at the Reserve Officer School
  and our team ranked second, after only the team of Utti Jaeger Regiment.

Cycling
: For me cycling is not a racing sport, instead it is a healthy sporty mode 
  of transport. I have done much of my commuting by bike since my childhood, 
  even during the winter months. According to Sports Tracker I cycled 3689 
  km in 2018 and my record is 2016 during which I cycled 4048 km and spent 
  150279 kilocalories doing so. My longest distance within a day is 201 km 
  (from Tampere to Helsinki) which I completed in 8h50 plus a lunch break.

Martial arts
: I have casually trained various martial arts to keep me physically fit
  and capable, including hokutoryu ju-jitsu, Brazilian ju-jitsu, judo 
  wrestling, aikido, boxing, kickboxing and muay Thai. I have also earned a 
  diploma for completing a training to act as a sports wrestling instructor. I 
  have organized and taught several courses in martial arts during my military 
  service and while leading the martial arts association Otaniemi Fight Club.

Other sports
: I have also more or less regularly trained (and in some instances even
  competed) in many other sports including strength training, bodypump, 
  indoor and outdoor swimming, kayaking, orienteering, backcountry skiing, 
  ski trekking, hiking, trekking, bouldering, top-rope climbing, tennis, 
  football. For instance, with my friends we have completed trekking trips 
  such as trekking 101 km and sleeping two nights at uninsulated lean-tos 
  around snowy Koli National Park in 49 hours, ski trekking 73 km on the 
  frozen Baltic Sea and sleeping in a tent on an island in 24 hours, 
  backcountry skiing 71 km in 14 hours, and kayaking 53 km in 41 hours in 
  the archipelago of Porkkala. Also with my wife we have trekked 64 km 
  with 5627 meters of ascent and 5678 meters of descent from Albania to 
  Montenegro through the Accursed Mountains in three days and eg. 
  conquered Hochstuhl in 9 hours (~20 km with ~1930 meters of ascent and 
  descent).

Competitive dancing
: During 2008-2017 I have semi-regularly taken courses in different types
  of partner dancing styles and attended dance parties. However, since 
  2017 I have been training more intensively to develop myself as a 
  competitive West Coast swing dancer. In summer 2019 I earned my first 
  WSDC point and with my wife we finished third in a Strictly Swing 
  competition in Tampere. Other dance styles I have trained include tango, 
  salsa, Brazilian zouk, ballet, hip hop, jazz, modern dancing and Finnish 
  folk dancing. In 2019, I have spent an average of about 1 hour per day
  developing my dancing, as of September 17th.

<!-- As I have always been genuinely interested about technology and what is possible
  and thus I have studied technology a lot also during my free time. -->
Learning about technology
: 2003-2007 Electronics and microcontroller programming
  : In my early teens I studied electronics and microcontroller programming
    with BASIC and PICAXE. I designed and fabricated various interesting 
    electronic devices and systems in our garage out of circuit boards, 
    transistors, relays, electric motors, batteries, LEDs, sensors as well as 
    radio transmitters and receivers. Examples include a smart bike lighting 
    system that automatically turns on in the dark, a miniature electric motor 
    boat controlled wirelessly using infrared light, a miniature off-road four 
    wheeler controlled remotely using radio signals. Back then there were no 
    cheap project kits available so I had to do things my way. I also did a 
    lot of research and planning with the aim of building a custom electric 
    motorbike but in the end decided it was not wise to continue with the 
    investments.
: 2006-2008 Game software development
  : In my mid teens I got intensely engaged in learning programming and game 
    development. I developed an experimental turn-based strategy game inspired 
    by both *Warhammer* and *Shogun: Total War* using Java. I was more 
    interested in realism, strategy and game dynamics than graphical 
    appearance so I never developed the game to look very good. However, later 
    I experimented with C++, OpenGL and the Irrlicht 3D engine to develop a 
    more visual 3D game. These forays into electronics and game development 
    led me to study electronics, both procedural and object-oriented 
    programming, vector mathematics and physics and develop my own path 
    finding and artificial intelligence algorithms way before I heard of them 
    via formal education.
: 2006- GNU/Linux and open source
  : As I learned about the software development scene, I got enthusiastic about
    open source operating systems and software and started using and studying 
    them. Ever since I studied new software, programming languages and 
    libraries and have been developing and/or customizing various tools and 
    software for my own personal needs. For instance, I have developed daemons 
    to monitor and maintain my system, tailored my desktop environment ontop 
    of a customized window manager called awesome, track my daily time use 
    with a desktop app called Pomo I wrote in Python, back up my data with 
    Bash scripts that leverage `ssh`, `rsync`, `unison` and hard linking, 
    developed a `~/.bash_aliases` file that, as of now, contains 4448 rows and 
    370 functions, and an associated personal reference file with even more
    content, and I have a personal library of programs, scripts and other code
    with well over 50 k rows that I have myself written and/or adapted (in many
    cases several times) mostly in Python but also in C++, Bash, Octave, Ruby
    and others.

Investing in financial assets and the future
: I invest in stocks, real estate, and forestry. By the end of my studies I had
  developed a portfolio with a net worth of about 50 k€ out of my own earnings 
  from part-time work even though accumulating wealth had not been among my 
  top priorities during my student life by that point. I also try to become 
  net positive when it comes to my net environmental effects. Thus I try to 
  minimize my ecological footprint in many ways, contribute to eg. 
  [Compensate](https://compensate.com/) and try to raise awareness among 
  people around me. I believe these are ways to invest into a better and more 
  secure future.

Investing in strong general understanding of the world
: Inspired by the polymaths and Renaissance men of history I try to constantly
  study new information from a plethora of subjects, news and media sources, 
  as well as from non-fiction literature, and knowledge repositories such as 
  [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/). I try aim to keep myself civilized 
  and informed in order to ensure I have sound judgement. I used to also 
  actively contribute to discussions in social media. Themes I currently find 
  interesting include economics, politics, climate change and health among 
  others. In 2019, I have invested about 172 hours into civilizing myself, as 
  of September 17th.
