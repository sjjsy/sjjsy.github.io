My thesis was part of the DICIA research project led by Aalto Department of Industrial Engineering and Management. The thesis is titled *“Digitalization of Language Services: A Strategy for a Remote Interpretation Spin-Off“*.

The work involved a) a study of the venture; b) a quantitative analysis of its platform transaction database; c) a desktop study of the language services industry and language technology; d) a qualitative research of the interpretation industry in Finland (including 19 semi-structured interviews and 2 focus group discussions); e) an analysis of the past and future evolution of the remote interpretation industry; f) the development of a comprehensive strategy based on a competitive strategy framework for digital platform-based startups.

Professor Ilkka Kauranen supervised my thesis work and awarded it the grade 4/5.

Metadata of the thesis is available at [AaltoDoc](https://aaltodoc.aalto.fi/handle/123456789/39098)."	Developing a strategy for a venture in the remote-video interpretation industry	Doing my Master’s Thesis

My major studies (47 ECTS; grade 5/5) gave me broad understanding and knowhow in relation to the strategic management of both established and new businesses. My minor studies (22 ECTS; grade 4/5) gave me broad understanding and knowhow in relation to statistical analysis, operations research, artificial intelligence and associated computational methodologies. My degree also included studies (26 ECTS; grade 5/5) on leadership, project-based management, entrepreneurship, sales, software development and language courses in French and Swedish. Note that my Master’s Thesis, which was also a part of my degree (30 ECTS), is described [separately](#aalto-mth).

I completed the degree with honours (GPA 4.40/5.00) and I also received the Dean’s Incentive Scholarship for my fast pace of study attainment.

During my studies at Aalto I accumulated a total of 345 ECTS which shows that I studied and even completed a lot of courses in addition to those required by my degrees. These included courses for example on entrepreneurial marketing, data structures and algorithms, corporate finance, and the conceptual prerequisites for attaining the Lean Six Sigma Green Belt."

Originally they were seeking to hire a person for a full-time COO role. The fast growth of the business had led to a situation in which the CEO and majority owner of the company was increasingly short of time and thus felt a need for help running the firm. My analysis was such that they needed to make a broader leap of transformation to a [professional bureaucracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organizational_structure#Bureaucratic_structures) which relies less on the entrepreneur and more on hired professionals and organizational structures and processes. Thus we adopted a consultative relationship in which I collaborated with the entrepreneur, the future CEO and the Executive Assistant that we later hired to make this leap.

My work thus consisted of both high level work, such as organization development, human resources development, process development, and strategy, and practical work, such as accounting, customer service and process improvement work. Later as the transition was progressing well I started to also contribute significantly to their product development. I recruited new software developers and worked to improve the software development practices applied in the firm."

The topic of the research project was non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) and energy disaggregation (ie. identifying specific energy consumers from aggregate energy consumption data). With our team we developed an advanced disaggregation algorithm, an unsupervised nonparametric factorial hidden Markov model (NFHMM), which is available in its own [repository](https://github.com/sjjsy/sor-nilm). We also developed a fork of the non-intrusive load monitoring toolkit (NILMTK) which is also available in its own [repository](https://github.com/sjjsy/nilmtk).
