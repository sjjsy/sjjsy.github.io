# My personal website

This is based on the Jekyll theme [Minimal 
Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/).

The purpose of the site is to enable and/or facilitate
- Professional marketing -- Having a site where I have my résumé with all
  professionally relevant work, project and other experiences, knowhow and
  skillsets described as well as any references listed that I have accumulated
  can be very effective when marketing one's self professionally. I can link
  relevant pages to my LinkedIn, job applications, business card, and/or other
  marketing material as well as refer to it in speech or when messaging.
- Social marketing -- Having a site where people can learn about who I am,
  what I do and like, and how to contact me can be very useful for people.
  As with professional marketing I can similarly link this to my social media
  profiles and/or spread it in other ways.
- Blogging -- When I feel like writing about something, I can do so publicly
  at my personal website and potentially share the posts to wherever I like
  for example to leverage network effects in social media platforms.
- Sharing -- I can add custom pages or content whenever I have a need to do so.
- Extendability -- If someday I have the drive, I can always choose to expand
  the site and perhaps, along the years, it will grow and I will enjoy seeing
  it do so.

The overall plan of the site is as follows:

| URL             | Purpose                                                                        |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `/`             | A landing page for briefly introducing the visitor to the contents of the site |
| `/about`        | To describe who am I and what this site is about                               |
| `/now`          | To describe what I'm currently up to                                           |
| `/resume`       | To describe my résumé as well as provides content for professional marketing   |
| `/blog`         | To provide a root page for exploring the blog                                  |
